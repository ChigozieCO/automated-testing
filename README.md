This project is a quick sample project that demonstrates the automation of the build, test, and deployment process of an application to a staging environment on push to the main branch. 

To adequately demonstrate the CI/CD pipeline, I will create a simple Python project with minimal code and then integrate it into GitHub Actions.

# Project File

I create a basic python application that I will use in the pipeline, you can find it [here](./app.py)

# Project Requirements

A typical project would have dependencies and in a python project they are usually defined in the `requirements.txt` file. 

This file will list any dependencies my project needs (in this case, none are required, but I added pytest for testing). Find it [here](./requirements.txt)

# Unit Test

I added a basic test file `test_app.py` to test the function in app.py. Find the unit test [here](./test_app.py).

# Pipeline

The [pipeline](./github/workflows/proj.yml) will define the steps for building, testing, and deploying my Python project.

### Breakdown of the CI/CD Pipeline Steps

- **Trigger on Push to main**: The pipeline is triggered whenever there is a push to the main branch.

- **Checkout Code**: This step uses GitHub’s checkout action to pull my code from the repository.

- **Set Up Python**: The pipeline sets up a Python environment on the CI runner (GitHub's virtual machine), ensuring that the correct Python version is used.

- **Install Dependencies**: It installs the required dependencies for my Python project (pytest in this case). This dependency was just added as an example of when a project has dependencies as this particular sample python application does not require any.

- **Build**: This stage was also just added for demonstration purposes, supposing this was a JavaScript/Node.js project this is where we would run the `npm run build` command and this will create an artifact we can upload and use in the deploy stage.

  Since this is a python project and it doesn't really require a build, I created a file and folder in this stage. The file will serve as my artifact for the deploy stage.

- **Run Tests**: It runs the tests using pytest to validate the code.

- **Upload Build Artifact**: After running the tests, the build-and-test stage creates and saves a build artifact (in this case, a simulated output_file.txt in the build folder from the build step). The action `upload-artifact` is used to store this artifact.

- **Deploy Stage**: My application will only be deployed if the test was successful which is why I have added the conditionals `needs and if`. Using “needs” we can require that the deploy job won’t even run unless the test job is successful.

  The `download-artifact` action retrieves the build artifact and the last step "Simulate Deployment" simulates deployment by printing a message and list the artifact. If this was an live project I would have the actual deployment commands to deploy to a real staging environment here.

  This approach ensures that the output from the build-and-test stage is properly passed to the deploy stage, simulating how a real deployment would work with build artifacts.
